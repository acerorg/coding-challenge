## Problem (TBD)
#### Examples
1. Purchasing - A product has multiple purchasing methods.
2. Password Hashing and Complexity
3. Reporting. As we have it on the online technical test

## Development Environment
1. You can choose either PHP, JavaScript or Typescript to complete this coding challenge.
2. Create a public repository in GitHub. Set the repository name to a UUID.
3. As you develop, make commits to this repository
4. We expect to see the application along with automated tests
5. When you are complete, share the repository URL with the person who shared this exercise
6. For us to run the application and tests, use one of the following options based on the programming language of choice:
  - ##### Option: PHP with Docker Compose Option
    1. Try using Docker Compose to run the application and tests, as this reduces dependency on the host machine
    2. For example, `docker-compose run test` to run the tests and `docker-compose run app` to run the application
    3. Place the instructions in README.md
  - ##### Option: PHP with detailed instructions
    1. You can leave detailed instructions including prerequisites, command to run application and command to run tests
    2. Place the instructions in README.md
  - ##### Option: JavaScript/TypeScript with NPM scripts
    1. Try adding scripts to `package.json` to run the application and tests

## Continuous Integration
1. Use GitHub Actions to run tests
